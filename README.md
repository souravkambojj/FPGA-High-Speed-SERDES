# High-Speed-SERDES
â€¢	Developed FPGA based High Speed  SERDES  for Data Processing Unit 

The code of High Speed  SERDES was written in VHDL using ALTGX IP Cores and its
Synthesis was done Atlera Stratix IV GX FPGA Development  kit  using Quartus II v14.0.

The Serdes accepts parallel digital data from six IR-sensors mounted on aircraft and convert 
it into serial encoded form so as to be processed by DPU(Data Processing Unit) to alert 
CMDS(Countermeasures Dispensing System) from external threats.
